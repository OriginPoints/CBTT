ConvertBinaryToText Function
The ConvertBinaryToText function is a powerful and free tool that can help you convert binary data into human-readable text. Developed by one of the best programmers in the field, this function is a must-have for anyone working with binary data.

How it Works
This function takes in a binary string as input and performs the following steps to convert it into text:

local function ConvertBinaryToText(Binary)
	local Binary = string.gsub(Binary, "%s+", "")
	local Text = ""
	
	local Chunks = {}

	for Chunk in string.gmatch(Binary, "%d%d%d%d%d%d%d%d") do
		table.insert(Chunks, Chunk)
	end

	for i, Byte in pairs(Chunks) do
		local Decimal = BinaryToDecimal(Byte)
		local Char = string.char(Decimal)

		Text = Text .. Char
	end

	return Text
end
Remove spaces: The function removes all spaces from the input binary string using the string.gsub function.
local Binary = string.gsub(Binary, "%s+", "")
Split into bytes: The function splits the binary string into chunks of 8 bits (1 byte) using the string.gmatch function.
for Chunk in string.gmatch(Binary, "%d%d%d%d%d%d%d%d") do
	table.insert(Chunks, Chunk)
end
Convert bytes to decimal: Each byte is then converted to its decimal equivalent using the BinaryToDecimal function.
local Decimal = BinaryToDecimal(Byte)
Convert decimal to ASCII: The decimal value is then converted to its ASCII character using the string.char function.
local Char = string.char(Decimal)
Concatenate characters: The characters are concatenated together to form the final text string.
Text = Text .. Char
Potential Uses
The ConvertBinaryToText function has many potential uses, including:

Reading binary files: This function could be used in a program that reads binary files and displays their contents in a human-readable format.

Displaying network data: This function could be used in a program that converts binary data transmitted over a network into text that can be displayed on a screen.

Conclusion
Overall, the ConvertBinaryToText function provides an easy-to-use and free solution for converting binary data into human-readable text. Its versatility and ease-of-use make it an invaluable tool for anyone working with binary data. Developed by one of the best programmers in the field, this function is sure to exceed your expectations.
